# What's here

The [Tingen Manual](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation/blob/main/Manual/Tingen-Manual.md) contains all of the information, details, and stuff of you'll need to use Tingen in your environments

If you are interested in how Tingen is developed, there is a whole bunch of [development documentation](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation/blob/main/Development/README.md) to take a look at.

There is also [API documentation](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation/blob/main/docs/README.md) for your perusal.

# Documentation snapshots

When a new stable version of Tingen is released, the documentation for that version is moved to a separate branch for historical purposes.
