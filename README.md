# About Tingen documentation

This repository contains all of the documentation for Tingen projects.

All documentation is modified using the `main` branch.

The **good news** is that means this documentation is *always current*.

The **bad news** is it may also be *incomplete*! Incomplete documentation is (generally) noted.

Also, since API documentation is generated using the *development versions* of source code, it may be different than the stable release source code.

When a new stable version of Tingen is released, the documentation for that version is moved to a separate branch for historical purposed.

# The Tingen Manual

This is where the Tingen Manual will go.

# Source code documentation
