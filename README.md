# The Tingen Manual

The Tingen [Manual](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation/blob/main/Manual/Tingen-Manual.md) contains all of the information, details, and stuff of you'll need to use Tingen in your environments

# Development documentation

If you are interested in how Tingen is developed, there is a whole bunch of [development documentation](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation/blob/main/Development/README.md) to take a look at.

# API documentation

There is also [API documentation](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation/blob/main/docs/README.md) for your perusal.

## A note about the API documentation

API documentation is modified using the `development` branches of Tingen and Outpost31.

The **good news** is that means this documentation is *always current*.

The **bad news** is it may also be *incomplete*! Incomplete documentation is (generally) noted.

Also, since API documentation is generated using the *development versions* of source code, it may be different than the stable release source code.

# Documentation snapshots

When a new stable version of Tingen is released, the documentation for that version is moved to a separate branch for historical purposes.
