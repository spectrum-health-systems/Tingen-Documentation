# About Tingen Documentation

This repository contains documentation for the following:

* [Tingen_development](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Development)
* [Outpost31](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Outpost31)
* [Tingen](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen)
* [Tingen Community Release](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-CommunityRelease)
* [Tingen DevDeploy](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-DevDeploy)

All documentation is modified using the `main` branch.

The **good news** is that means this documentation is *always current*.

The **bad news** is it may also be *incomplete*! Incomplete documentation is (generally) noted.

Also, since API documentation is generated using the *development versions* of source code, it may be different than the stable release source code.

When a new stable version of Tingen is released, the documentation for that version is moved to a separate branch for historical purposed.

# The Tingen Manual
