# About the Tingen Documentation Project

This repository contains:

* The Tingen [Manual](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation/blob/main/Manual/Tingen-Manual.md)

* [Development documentation](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation/blob/main/Development/README.md) for various Tingen-related projects

* Tingen/Outpost31 [API documentation](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation/blob/main/docs/README.md)

## A note about the API documentation

API documentation is modified using the `development` branches of Tingen and Outpost31.

The **good news** is that means this documentation is *always current*.

The **bad news** is it may also be *incomplete*! Incomplete documentation is (generally) noted.

Also, since API documentation is generated using the *development versions* of source code, it may be different than the stable release source code.

## Documentation snapshots

When a new stable version of Tingen is released, the documentation for that version is moved to a separate branch for historical purposes.
