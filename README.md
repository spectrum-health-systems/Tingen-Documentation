# About Tingen documentation

This repository contains all of the documentation for Tingen projects.

Since this repository only contains a `main` branch:

- This he documentation is always current, therefore...
- There may be incomplete and/or missing documentation

Also, since API documentation is generated using development versions of source code, it may be different than the stable release source code.

# The Tingen Glosary

The [Tingen Glossary](Glossary.md) is a living document that contains important keywords and terminology related to Tingen projects.

# The Tingen Manual

This is where the Tingen Manual will go.

# Source code documentation

- [API documentation](./docs/README.md)

# Development documentation

- [Development documentation](./Development/README.md)
