## A note about the API documentation

This documentation is generated by [Sandcastle File Help Builder](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB) using the Visual Studio 2022 projects located [here](../../sfhb/).

API documentation is modified using the `development` branches of Tingen and Outpost31.

The **good news** is that means this documentation is *always current*.

The **bad news** is it may also be *incomplete*! Incomplete documentation is (generally) noted.

Also, since API documentation is generated using the *development versions* of source code, it may be different than the stable release source code.
