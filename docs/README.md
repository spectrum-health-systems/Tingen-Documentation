# API documentation

Check out this cool API documentation:

* [Tingen Web Service](https://spectrum-health-systems.github.io/Tingen-Documentation/API/Tingen-WebService/html/N_TingenWebService.htm)

* [Outpost31](https://spectrum-health-systems.github.io/Tingen-Documentation/API/Outpost31/index.html)

* [Tingen Commander](https://spectrum-health-systems.github.io/Tingen-Documentation/API/Tingen-Commander/html/N_TingenCommander.htm)

## A note about the API documentation

API documentation is modified using the `development` branches of Tingen and Outpost31.

The **good news** is that means this documentation is *always current*.

The **bad news** is it may also be *incomplete*! Incomplete documentation is (generally) noted.

Also, since API documentation is generated using the *development versions* of source code, it may be different than the stable release source code.
