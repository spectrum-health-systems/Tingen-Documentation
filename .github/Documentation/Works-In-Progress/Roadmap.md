# Tingen Roadmap

- Currently a bunch of stuff is refreshed when Tingen is disabled, but those things need to be manually refreshed when it's enabled again. Is there an efficient way to check to see if there is a change back to enabled, and refresh things.

## Commander

- Runs processes after hours
- Killswitch

## Lieutenant

## DevDeploy

- Move stuff to it's own folder, since Lieutenant will do different things now

## Deployment folders

- Shared development deployment folders for Commander/Lieutenant/DevDeploy?
- Auto backups of previous/current versions

## Admin Module

- Verify framework
- Reset framework
- Reset config

## Current settings file

- Formatting is off
