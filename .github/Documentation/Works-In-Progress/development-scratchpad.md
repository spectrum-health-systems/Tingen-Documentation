# Tingen Development Notes

## Ability to save field data to local drive

- Should be saved to a folder that is always nuked (e.g., "TingenData\UAT\Ephmereal\")
- Should be encrypted

## Save an OptionObject locally

- Can be used for testing?
- Can be used so Commander/Lieutenant can call Tingen directly?

## Service status messages

- Only write to Remote\?

- Runaway processes/diskspace
